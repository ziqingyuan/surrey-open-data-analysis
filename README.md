## Project Description

This project involved the processing, cleaning, storing, and 
analysis of datasets obtained from the Open Data platform provided 
by the city of Surrey, BC, Canada. The study aimed to provide insights 
into how open data can be improved in terms of extension, maintenance, 
and user-friendliness. The analysis focused on exploring the correlation 
between restaurant and transit stop locations in the study area, with implications 
for urban planning and transportation infrastructure development. 

The project highlights the potential of open data to inform decision-making and 
facilitate evidence-based solutions to urban challenges.
